# Centralized Workflow
A centralized workflow assumes a single centralized shared repository on which multiple developers can have push access to.
One central hub or repository can accept code and everyone syncrhonizes their work to it.

# Integration-Manager Workflow
It was uses Github, when you fork.
This workflow includes a canonical repository that represents the "official" project. To contribute, you create your own public clone of the project and push your changes to it.
Then, you can send a request to the maitainer of the main project to pull in your changes.
The maintainer can then add your repository as a remote, test your cahnges locally, merge them into their branch and push back to their repository.

# Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow
This is for very large projects - is just me so haven't reached their yet.
